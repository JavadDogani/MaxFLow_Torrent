
Overview:
This project is a Python tool designed to transform a JSON file describing nodes, their neighbors, and the chunks they hold into a network model. The resulting network is then visualized, showcasing the relationships between nodes and the distribution of data chunks.

Features:
JSON Input: Input a JSON file that comprehensively describes the nodes in your network, their neighbors, and the chunks they are responsible for.

Network Model Construction: The code intelligently parses the provided JSON structure to build a network model that accurately represents the relationships between nodes and the chunks they manage.

MaxFlow Analysis: Utilize network flow analysis to calculate the maximum flow within the constructed model. This is particularly useful for understanding the optimal movement of data through the network.

Visualization: The tool includes a visualization component that generates a graphical representation of the network model, providing a clear and intuitive way to interpret the relationships and flow of data.

How to Use:
JSON Input: Prepare a JSON file named Torrent.Json according to the specified format, detailing the nodes, their neighbors, and the chunks associated with each node.

Run the Code: Execute the Python script, providing the path to your JSON file as input.

Visualize the Network: Explore the generated visualization to gain insights into the network structure, node relationships, and the distribution of data chunks.

Example Usage:

make torrent.json file in the directory
Copy code. 
python main.py 
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
NetworkX for network analysis
Matplotlib for visualization
